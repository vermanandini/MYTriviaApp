# Navigation


## Android Trivia 

The Android Trivia application is an application that asks the user trivia questions about Android development.  It makes use of the Navigation component within Jetpack to move the user between different screens.  Each screen is implemented as a Fragment.
The app navigates using buttons, the Action Bar, and the Navigation Drawer.
Since students haven't yet learned about saving data or the Android lifecycle, it tries to eliminate bugs caused by configuration changes. 







## Working with the  Code

Here are the basic steps for working with and completing exercises in the repo.

The basic steps are:

1. Clone the repo
2. Checkout the branch corresponding to the step you want to attempt
3. Find and complete the TODOs
4. Optionally commit your code changes
5. Compare your code with the solution
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until you've gone trough all the steps to complete the toy app


**Step 1: Clone the repo**

As you go through the course, you'll be instructed to clone the different exercise repositories, so you don't need to set these up now. You can clone a repository from github in a folder of your choice with the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

**Step 2: Checkout the step branch**

As you go through different steps in the code, you'll be told which step you're on, as well as a link to the corresponding branch.

You'll want to check out the branch associated with that step. The command to check out a branch would be:

```bash
git checkout BRANCH_NAME
```

**Step 3: Find and complete the TODOs**

Once you've checked out the branch, you'll have the code in the exact state you need. You'll even have TODOs, which are special comments that tell you all the steps you need to complete the exercise. You can easily navigate to all the TODOs using Android Studio's TODO tool. To open the TODO tool, click the button at the bottom of the screen that says TODO. This will display a list of all comments with TODO in the project. 



**Step 4: Commit your code changes**

After You've completed the TODOs, you can optionally commit your changes. This will allow you to see the code you wrote whenever you return to the branch. The following git code will add and save **all** your changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
